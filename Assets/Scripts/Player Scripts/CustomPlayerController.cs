// Setup:
// Kinematic Rigidbody + CapsuleCollider on Player root.
// Feet are assumed to sit at the object's pivot.
//
// Controller philosophy:
// - Rigidbody does NOT drive movement.
// - We manually integrate velocity.
// - Capsule sweeps detect collisions before movement.
// - Collisions are resolved using "collide and slide".
// - Kinematic Rigidbody mainly exists for:
//      1. Trigger interactions
//      2. Rigidbody interpolation
//
// This is essentially a custom kinetic character controller.
